My portfolio webpage.
Live page: http://jenniarg.com

I challenged myself to only use CSS for styling instead of using javascript or jquery. However, I wrote a javascript function to scroll the window up when clicking on the project titles or the "Close Info" buttons.

The following were created with pure CSS:

  - The webpage is responsive using media queries and non-fixed widths with inline elements
  - Navigation menu with responsive menu icon which changes to a close icon when clicked (hidden checkbox and labels)
  - Text overlays on hovering over the project images
  - Text overlay changing background color once clicked on for more information on a project
  - Displaying and hiding information by clicking on the project titles (with the use of hidden radio buttons and labels)
  - Uses Google fonts
  - Uses box shadows on project information background for styling effect
  - Uses borders and border radius on specific links to mimic a button
